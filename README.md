# Getting Started

**`lido-charon-distributed-validator-node` is a repo intended as a _deployment guide_ and is not intended to be the canonical way to deploy a distributed validator.**

**Operators are encouraged to use this repository to build and maintain their own configurations that work for their individual use case.**


Check the Obol [docs](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/start/quickstart_group) for detailed instructions on how to get started using example repos. 

To configure this repo for a particular network, follow these instructions. If you do not, your node will fail to start. 

1. Copy `.env.sample.<network-name>` to `.env`:
    ```sh
    # mainnet
    cp .env.sample.mainnet .env

    # holesky
    cp .env.sample.holesky .env
    ```
2. Grab your operator ID from the lido [mainnet dashboard](https://operators.lido.fi/) or [testnet dashboard](https://operators-holesky.testnet.fi/).
3. Find `VE_OPERATOR_ID` in `.env` and set it to your operator ID.
4. Save and close `.env`.

You will need a `.charon/` folder from a completed DKG present to complete the setup of this repo.
